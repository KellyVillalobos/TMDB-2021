# About

TMDB was a startup project I did for a military contract to update an Apache Struts based application to an Angular and Spring RESTful API based application. This project was built as an exercise in group development. In the end we build a partially functioning movie database that pulled movie data from a public movie API and developed an interface with features like a carousel, individual movie cards and table with breadcrumbs.

# TMDB

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
